# Singular
A collection of all my Singular libraries

`presmatrix.lib` is a mirror of the file found at
[Aldicio Jos√© Miranda's site](https://sites.google.com/site/aldicio/publicacoes/presentation-matrix-algorithm).

## Goals
- [ ] Create an interface to display results
- [ ] Separate the frontal library into two libraries, one for maps of corank 1 and another one for general properties of proper frontals.
