# Singular
A collection of all my Singular libraries

`presmatrix.lib` is a mirror of the file found at
[Aldicio Jos√© Miranda's site](https://sites.google.com/site/aldicio/publicacoes/presentation-matrix-algorithm).

## Goals
- [ ] Create an interface to display results.
- [x] Separate the frontal library into two libraries, one for maps of corank 1 and another one for general properties of proper frontals.
- [ ] Implement a program that computes the normal line.
	- [ ] Implement Gram-Schmidt.
	- [ ] Make it so we can compute whether the conditions for Mather-Gaffney are satisfied (in corank 1)
- [ ] Write documentation.
