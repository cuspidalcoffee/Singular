\section{Public procedures}
These procedures are available for other libraries and the end user to use.

\subsection{fcodim}
Given a frontal map germ $f\colon (N,x) \to (Z,y)$, compute the frontal codimension of $f$.
For plane curves, if we write the equation for the image of $f$ as $g=0$, we can use the formula
	\[\codim_{\ms{F}_e}f=\tau(g)-\delta(g)-\mult(g)+1\]
from \cite{MNODeformations}.

For the general case, let $g=0$ be the equation for the image of $f$ and $(f_t)$ be a frontal disentanglement of $f$ (see \cite{MNOSurfaces}) with equation $G=0$ in the image.
A conjecture by Nu√±o-Ballesteros states that
	\[\codim_{\ms{F}_e}f=\dim \frac{J(G)+(G)}{J_{rel}(G)+(g)}\otimes \mb{C}\{t\},\]
where $J(G)$ is the Jacobian ideal of $G$ and $J_{rel}(G)$ is the \emph{relative} Jacobian ideal, wherein the partial derivatives with respect to the parameter $t$ are ignored.

\section{Static procedures}
These procedures are only available for this library, and are declared with the \verb!static! type.
To make them available, simply remove the \verb!static! type in code.

\subsection{wdeg}
Given a weighted homogeneous polynomial $g \in \mb{K}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, there exist by definition $w_1,\dots,w_n, d \geq 0$ such that
	\[g((\lambda x_1)^{w_1},\dots,(\lambda x_n)^{w_n})=\lambda^dg(x_1^{w_1},\dots,x_n^{w_n}).\]
The values $w_1,\dots,w_n$ are known as the \emph{weights} of $g$, and $d$, as the \emph{weighted homogeneous degree} of $g$.
This procedure takes a weighted homogeneous polynomial $g$ and returns
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the weights of $g$;
	\item the weighted homogeneous degree of $g$.
\end{enumerate}
